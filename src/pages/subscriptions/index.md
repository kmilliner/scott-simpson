intro: >-
  One of our company-wide OKRs was to increase repeat purchase rate. At that
  time, our COA was high as we were competing for ad space with big industry
  players that had big budgets. Because of this, much of our focus was to find
  new revenue streams within our existing customer base. Subscriptions not only
  made it easier for our customers to regularly send flowers to themselves or
  loved ones, but it also encouraged repeat purchases.

why1: >-
  Our customers look much different than the average floral ecommerce customer.
  They send flowers on average of 3x per year vs the industry average of 1.5x
  per year. They also send throughout the year with most people sending for
  everyday occasions. This is in contrast to the big industry players like
  1800-Flowers where 50% of their revenue come on Valentine's Day and Mother's
  Day alone (vs 5.6% for us).

why2: >-
  Our customer care team was receiving multiple requests per week from customers
  who wanted fresh flowers regularly delivered to their home or office. We found
  that many of these people were manually sending themselves flowers along with
  a personal note of encouragement.

    They need to field questions around subscriptions, changes of address,
    cancellations etc. They need to have a good idea about how the subscription
    checkout flow works and what the limitations are to assist customers.

    They’ll have more recurring deliveries and they’ll be paying special

    They need to be informed on the timeline on subscriptions so they can
    forecast buying extra bouquets and work closely with Marketing and
    Merchandising as demand scales.

    They need to understand how the UX flow works, what subscription options are
    (duration, frequency, pricing tiers) and what transactional emails we need
    to build that into our admin system backend as well as frontend.
