title: UrbanStems Subscriptions
intro: >-
  One of our company-wide OKRs was to increase repeat purchase rate. At that
  time, our COA was high as we were competing for ad space with big industry
  players that had big budgets. Because of this, much of our focus that quarter
  was to find new revenue streams within our existing customer base.
  Subscriptions not only made it easier for our customers to regularly send
  flowers to themselves or loved ones, but it also encouraged repeat purchases.
