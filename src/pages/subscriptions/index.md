intro: >-
  One of our company-wide OKRs was to increase repeat purchase rate. At that
  time, our COA was high as we were competing for ad space with big industry
  players that had big budgets. Because of this, much of our focus that quarter
  was to find new revenue streams within our existing customer base.
  Subscriptions not only made it easier for our customers to regularly send
  flowers to themselves or loved ones, but it also encouraged repeat purchases.

  One of our company-wide OKRs was to increase repeat purchase rate. At that

  was to find new revenue streams within our existing customer base.
  Subscriptions not only made it easier for our customers to regularly send
  flowers to themselves or loved ones, but it also encouraged repeat purchases.
why1: >
  The typical ecommerce customer buys flowers on average 1.5x per year mostly
  for special occasions like Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. Around 50% of the
  annual revenue of big industry players like 1800-Flowers comes on those two
  days alone. At UrbanStems our customers look completely different. Only 5.6%
  of our revenue came on major holidays with most people sending for everyday
  occasions throughout the year. They also send more often – on average 3x per
  year. This gave us some strong data that their buying habits were different
  and skewed towards sending more regularly – something closer aligned with a
  subscription model.
why2: >-
  Our customer care team was receiving multiple requests per week from customers
  who wanted fresh flowers regularly delivered to their home or office. We found
  that many of these people were manually sending themselves flowers along with
  a note of encouragement. In addition, none of our competitors, especially the
  big industry players, had subscription services in place due to their reliance
  on local florists for fulfillment. As we were vertically integrated and had
  control over the supply chain and end delivery, it seemed like a good
  opportunity to fill a need in the market without major implications on our
  fulfillment process.

    They need to field questions around subscriptions, changes of address,
    cancellations etc. They need to have a good idea about how the subscription
    checkout flow works and what the limitations are to assist customers.

    They’ll have more recurring deliveries and they’ll be paying special
    attention to subscriptions (such as including a vase in the first delivery).

business:

    They need to be informed on the timeline on subscriptions so they can
    forecast buying extra bouquets and work closely with Marketing and
    Merchandising as demand scales.

    They need to understand how the UX flow works, what subscription options are
    (duration, frequency, pricing tiers) and what transactional emails we need
    to build that into our admin system backend as well as frontend.
